5 MW Small Scale Taraila Small Hydroelectric Project by Ginni Global Ltd.
_______________________________

The proposed project activity with title under UCR “5 MW (2 x 2.5 MW) Small Scale Taraila Small Hydroelectric Project by Ginni Global Ltd.”, is a grid connected Hydro Electric Power project located in Chamba district in the state of Himachal Pradesh (India). Taraila Small Hydroelectric Project is a run-of-river project. The estimated annual CO2e emission reductions by the project activity are expected to be 15,768 tCO2e.

The proposed project activity is promoted by M/S Ginni Global Ltd (herein after called as project 
proponent ‘PP’). The proposed project activity is installation and operation of two Horizontal 
Francis Turbine having individual capacity 2500 kW with aggregated installed capacity of 5 MW in 
District Chamba, Himachal Pradesh state of India. This project activity is also called as Taraila 
Small Hydroelectric Project.

Taraila Small Hydroelectric Project is a run-of-river project on Taraila Nallah, a tributary of Baira 
Nallah in district Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. The project envisages a generation capacity of 5 MW 
of power by utilizing the available head. The project activity aims to harness kinetic energy of water 
(renewable source) to generate electricity. The project comprises a Trench weir which diverts the 
water into an intake placed on the left bank of the river. The diverted water passes through Desilting 
basin. Desilted water enters into water conductor system, forebay and the steel pressure shaft. A 
surface powerhouse is suitably located on a terrace at left bank of the river. Tail water from the 
powerhouse is discharged back into the khad. The project activity has been commissioned for 
commercial operation as on 15/11/2007.

The net generated electricity from the project activity is sold to state electricity board i.e., Himachal 
Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB) under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed 
between the PP and the utility. In pre-project scenario, electricity delivered to the grid by the project 
activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of fossil fuel-based grid-connected 
power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuel-based generation sources in the grid. As the 
nature of the hydro project, no fossil fuel is involved for power generation in the project activity. 
The electricity produced by the project is directly contributing to climate change mitigation by 
reducing the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by displacing an 
equivalent amount of power at grid.
